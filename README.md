## Credits

The code for this game is forked from
[Attacke! by Daniel Schulz](https://github.com/iamschulz/attacke) and owes a great deal of its
structure (especially the event system, main loop, and configuration files) to
that game. Thanks Daniel for an
[excellent tutorial](https://iamschulz.com/writing-a-game-in-typescript/)!
